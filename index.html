            <ul>
                <p>Elon was born in 1971 in South Africa.</p>
                <p>He used to read 10 hours per day.</p>
                <p>Musk learned BASIC in 3 days.</p>
                <p>In 1983 he created a video game and sold it for 500$.</p>
                <p>At the age of 14, Elon decided that his life mission is to save humanity.</p>
                <p>In 1989, he started college in Ontario.</p>
                <p>In 1994, he got Wharton economics and physics degrees.</p>
                <p>After that he worked two intern jobs and brainstormed ideas.</p>

                <p>In 1995, Musk starts Zip2 with his brother, coding it himself.</p>
                <p>After sleeping in the office for 3 months, he raised his first investment money (3M), and later sold his share for $22
                Million.</p>

                <p>In 2001, Elon moved to LA to be closer to the space industry and learned how to build rockets from books.</p>
                <p>In 2002, after finding out that rockets are overpriced, the ambitious entrepreneur started Space X and got 250M from

                successful which won him a NASA contract for 12 flights for $1,6 Billion. In december 2008, hours before going bankrupt,
